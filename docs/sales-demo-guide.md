# FirstLook Scan — Sales Demo Guide

## Goal of the Demo
Show how FirstLook Scan helps deal teams **decide where to look first** after documents are uploaded.

This is **not** a legal decision tool and should never be positioned as one.

---

## Demo Setup
You will receive:
- A demo URL
- A demo access code

Do not share the access code publicly.

---

## Recommended Demo Flow (10 minutes)

### 1) Access the Demo
- Open the URL
- Enter the demo access code

### 2) Load Sample Deal (Recommended)
- Click **“Load Sample Deal”**
- Wait for scan to complete

Avoid uploading your own documents unless asked.

---

### 3) Start at the Heatmap
Say:
> “This shows the worst risk per clause type per contract, sorted by total risk.”

Explain:
- Rows = contracts
- Columns = clause types
- Colors indicate severity

Ask:
> “Is this how you’d want to decide which contracts get reviewed first?”

---

### 4) Show Top Risks
Scroll to **Top Risks**.

Say:
> “This flips the workflow from document-first to issue-first.”

---

### 5) Drill into Termination or Change of Control
Open a finding.

Say:
> “This is the **exact contract language** — the tool doesn’t invent summaries.”

Emphasize:
- Quote-only extraction
- Issue-first organization

---

## Key Messages to Emphasize
- “Upstream triage”
- “Quote-only extraction”
- “Helps prioritize review”
- “Re-sequences legal effort”

---

## What NOT to Say
Do **not** say:
- “This replaces legal review”
- “This finds everything”
- “This automates diligence”
- “This guarantees accuracy”

---

## If Asked About Limitations
Say:
> “This is intentionally conservative. It surfaces what’s worth looking at first.”

---

## Demo Rules
- Do not upload confidential or real deal documents
- Use the sample dataset unless explicitly asked otherwise
- Keep demos short and focused

---

## Success Signal
Strong reactions sound like:
- “This would help us prioritize”
- “This should sit right after upload”
- “Our users ask for this”

Those are wins.
